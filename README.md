Installation instructions
-------------------------

 1. Clone this repo and `cd` to it.
 2. Run `make`.  
    This creates a Python virtualenv and downloads & installs all the tools.
    They will be installed in a subfolder called `.local`, under which a whole
    tree of files you don't necessarily have to interact with can be found. 
 3. To actually run any commands, first use `. startsession.sh` in a terminal
    session. This makes sure that all environment variables are set.
